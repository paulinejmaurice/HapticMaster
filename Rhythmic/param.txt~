% File containing all the parameters defining the cup task

% Name of file where results are written (placed in folder "Output": this folder must exist prior to launching the program). 
% A file is created for each trial in the block, and the number of the trial is appended to the file name (number starts at 0)
% The file extension is .csv and is added automatically. 
outputFilename = Pauline 

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% DISPLAY %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% Choose between local display (0) or projector screen (1)
projector = 1

% Ratio between the distances on screen and the physical distances. All the visual (start to target and cup) are scaled (1 means visual and physical distances are equal)
% If the scaling factor is big and the screen is small, then some parts of the task won't appear on the screen (they don't "fit" in the screen size)
visualScalingFactor = 2.

% Whether a sound is played (1) to indicate the start and end of each trial, or not (0)
sound = 1


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% BLOCK PARAMETERS %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% Number of trials in one block
nbTrials = 20

% To get the best score the task must be completed within this time exactly (going faster or slower means you get less points)
% The descending timing box on the screen gives you the reference time: you need to end the motion when the timing box exactly overlaps the target box in order to get the best score
% In seconds
goalTime = 2.

% Physical distance you want to cover with the HM end-effector, from start to target (distance between centers of both boxes)
% Along a horizontal line
% In meters
startToTargetDistance = 0.5

% Whether each trial starts automatically (1) or starts when a motion of the HM end-effector is detected (0)
autoStart = 0

% Whether the ball can escape the cup (1) or not (0) when the pendulum angle exceed the cup angle
ballEscape = 0

% Whether the user chooses the frequency of back and forth motion (1) or whether it is imposed by a metronome (0)
selfPaced = 0

% Ratio between the size of the target (and start block) and the size of the cup
% Depending on the width of the block, the user is more or less free to choose the amplitude of motion
accuracyFactor = 1.3

% Reference height for the Haptic Master (0 corresponds to the center of the HM vertical workspace)
% Change the value depending on the subjects' stature so that they are comfortable
% Should not exceed +/- 0.15 m (0.2 m is the limit but it is aviced against working at the limit of the worskpace)
% In meters
floorHeight = -0.05

% Amplify the acceleration of the cart (i.e. HM effector) for the cart-pendulum model to make the task harder
% This does not directly modify the motion of the HM, but the acceleration used in the cart-pendulum equation is acc_model = amplification * real_HM_acc 
% (so this affects the motion of the pendulum and then the reaction force on the cart)
% !! This factor seems (to be checked) to make the cart-pendulum system non-physical/unstable
accelerationAmplification = 1.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% PHYSICAL PARAMETRS OF CART-PENDULUM SYSTEM %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% Inertia of the HM (related to cart + pendulum mass)
% Must be >= 2. (HM restriction, see manual)
% In kg
inertiaHM = 3.5

% Mass of the ball/pendulum
% In kg
pendulumMass = 0.4

% Length of the pendulum, which determines the cup curvature
% In meters
pendulumLength = 0.05

% Damping in the pendulum (to be more realistic)
% In Newton.meters.second
pendulumDamping = 0.

% Initial angle of the pendulum (position of the ball in the cup)
% Positive in the counter-clockwise direction
% In degrees
pendulumInitialAngle = 0.

% Initial velocity of the pendulum/ball
% In degrees/second
pendulumInitialVelocity = 0.

% Angular length of the arc representing the cup. 
% The cup is symetric wrt verical axis. 
% The shape of the cup is defined both by arcCup (portion of full circle) and by pendulumLength (curvature)
% In degrees
arcCup = 100
